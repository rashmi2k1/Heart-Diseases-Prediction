# Heart-Diseases-Prediction
Academic Project

Cardiovascular diseases are the most common cause of death worldwide over the last few decades in the developed as well as underdeveloped and developing countries. Early detection of cardiac diseases and continuous supervision of clinicians can reduce the mortality rate. However, accurate detection of heart diseases in all cases and consultation of a patient for 24 hours by a doctor is not available since it requires more sapience, time and expertise. 

For the accurate detection of the heart disease, an efficient machine learning technique should be used which had been derived from a distinctive analysis among several machine learning algorithms in a Java Based Open Access Data Mining Platform, WEKA.

This data set dates from 1988 and consists of four databases: Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and Long Beach V. It contains 76 attributes, including the predicted attribute, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. The "target" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued 0 = no disease and 1 = disease.

Attribute Information:

age

sex

chest pain type (4 values)

resting blood pressure

serum cholestoral in mg/dl

fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl

resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)

maximum heart rate achieved

exercise induced angina

oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest

the slope of the peak exercise ST segment

number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy

thal: 0 = normal; 1 = fixed defect; 2 = reversable defect

The names and social security numbers of the patients were recently removed from the database, replaced with dummy values.
